# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Commands

```bash
npm run dev          # Start dev server
npm run build        # Production build
npm run typecheck    # TypeScript check (no emit)
npm run lint         # ESLint
```

There is no test framework configured — verify correctness with `typecheck` + `build`.

Before marking any work complete, always run:
```bash
npm run lint && npm run typecheck && npm run build
```

## Architecture

**Stack:** Next.js 15 App Router · TypeScript · Supabase (auth + DB + storage) · Tailwind CSS · React Hook Form + Zod · TanStack React Query

### Role system

Five roles defined in `src/types/auth.ts`:

| Role | Layout component | Root path |
|------|-----------------|-----------|
| `admin` | `AdminLayout` | `/pages/admin` |
| `expert` | `ExpertDashboardLayout` | `/pages/expert/clients` |
| `company_owner` | `DashboardLayout` | `/pages/agency` |
| `care_coordinator` | `DashboardLayout` | `/pages/agency/clients` |
| `staff_member` | `StaffLayout` | `/pages/caregiver` |

Roles are stored in the `user_profiles` table and checked server-side on every protected page.

### Page protection pattern

Every protected page is a **server component** that runs one of these checks before rendering:

```ts
// Admin-only
const { user, profile } = await requireAdmin()          // src/lib/auth-helpers.ts

// Any authenticated role with manual check
const session = await getSession()                       // src/lib/auth.ts
if (!session) redirect('/pages/auth/login')
if (session.profile?.role !== 'expert') redirect('/pages/expert/clients')
```

`requireAdmin()` redirects non-admins to `/pages/agency`. Use `getSession()` for other roles and add the role check yourself.

### Supabase clients — pick the right one

| Client | File | When to use |
|--------|------|-------------|
| `createClient()` | `src/lib/supabase/server.ts` | All normal server-side reads/writes; respects RLS |
| `createAdminClient()` | `src/lib/supabase/admin.ts` | Bypasses RLS — only for genuine service-level operations (creating data on behalf of another user, cross-agency admin operations) |
| Browser client | `src/lib/supabase/client.ts` | Client components that need live subscriptions |

Never expose `createAdminClient()` output to the browser.

**`createAdminClient()` is not a workaround for missing RLS policies.** If a role legitimately needs access to a table but RLS blocks it, write a migration to add the policy — do not reach for the admin client. Using the admin client to paper over an RLS gap leaves the gap permanently unfixed and creates a false sense of security.

**RLS-blocked mutations fail silently.** Supabase returns `{ error: null }` when an UPDATE or DELETE is blocked by RLS if the query has no `.select()` after it — 0 rows are affected but no error is raised. Always verify mutations by adding `.select()` or checking affected row count, especially in server actions used by non-admin roles.

### Query layer (`src/lib/supabase/query/`)

All DB access goes through named functions in this directory. Each function takes a Supabase client as its first argument and returns `Promise<{ data: T | null, error: PostgrestError | null }>`. The barrel `index.ts` re-exports everything — import as `import * as q from '@/lib/supabase/query'`.

### Server actions (`src/app/actions/`)

Server actions follow this shape:

```ts
'use server'
export async function doSomething(payload: FormData) {
  const supabase = await createClient()
  const { data: { user } } = await supabase.auth.getUser()
  // ... call q.someQuery(supabase, ...)
  revalidatePath('/pages/affected-route')
  revalidateTag(CACHE_TAG_SOMETHING)          // src/lib/cache-tags.ts
  return { error: null, data: { success: true } }
}
```

Always `revalidatePath` every role's route that displays the mutated data (e.g. both `/pages/admin/agencies` and `/pages/expert/agencies`).

### Caching

Reference-list data (agencies, license requirements, etc.) is cached with Next.js `unstable_cache` in `src/lib/server-cache/`. Cache tags are defined in `src/lib/cache-tags.ts`. Call `revalidateTag(TAG)` in server actions after mutations.

### Middleware (`src/middleware.ts`)

Runs on every request except `_next/static`, `_next/image`, and `favicon`. Calls `updateSession()` from `src/lib/supabase/middleware.ts` to refresh Supabase auth cookies. Public paths (login, signup, reset-password, `/`, `/auth/callback`) are the only routes that don't require a session — all redirects for unauthenticated users happen here.

### Forms

Use **React Hook Form** + **Zod** for all forms. Schemas live co-located with the component or in the component file itself. Server validation is always the source of truth; client-side Zod is UX only.

## HIPAA / Security rules

**Never:**
- Log PHI (names, addresses, DOB, notes, visit details, documents) anywhere.
- Store PHI in `localStorage`, `sessionStorage`, analytics, or error-monitoring payloads.
- Expose the service role key (`SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`) to the client.
- Bypass Supabase RLS without an explicit `createAdminClient()` call on the server.
- Create public storage buckets for patient, caregiver, visit, certification, or document files.
- Add third-party tools that may receive PHI without approval.
- Add `console.log` statements containing user, patient, caregiver, visit, or document data.

**Always:**
- Use server-side validation for sensitive actions.
- Preserve agency-level data isolation.
- Respect existing RLS policies.
- Use signed URLs for protected documents.
- Add audit logging for changes to visits, time entries, approvals, assignments, rates, and documents.
- Keep caregiver-visible notes separate from agency-only notes.
- Prefer immutable audit history over destructive updates.

**Before making any change:**
1. Read the relevant existing files first.
2. Identify any DB, auth, RLS, or API surface impact.
3. Do not rename tables, columns, routes, or shared types unless explicitly asked.

### RLS policy guidelines

RLS is the primary access control layer. Keep it correct rather than working around it.

- Every table must have explicit SELECT/INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE policies for each role that legitimately needs access.
- When adding a new feature that reads from a table a role hasn't accessed before, check whether an RLS SELECT policy exists for that role. If not, write a migration — do not use `createAdminClient()`.
- When writing a server action that mutates data and is called by a non-admin role, use `createClient()` (RLS client). If RLS blocks it, determine whether the role *should* have access (fix the policy) or *should not* (add an explicit server-side role guard instead of bypassing).
- `createAdminClient()` is appropriate when: creating/modifying data on behalf of another user (e.g. admin creating an application for an agency), reading data the role has UI access to but whose RLS is not yet defined (temporary, must be paired with a migration ticket), or operations that inherently span multiple users.
- Migration files live in `supabase/migrations/phase_two/`. Increment the prefix number. Run them in the Supabase SQL editor. The `is_platform_staff()` function (covers `admin` and `expert` roles) and `is_agency_member(agency_id)` are available for use in policies.
